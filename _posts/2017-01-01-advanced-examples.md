## SUMMARY
The applications webscrappers was the foundation of Google. Chat-GPT is reliant of Chatbot shells, but also on ML learning and alogorithms. Thus, NLP will be a fundamental part of the future enterprise applications and software engineering. NLP is a cross disciplary feild that can cross applications from medicince, business and technology as at the hear of all these fields is communication and the spread of knowledge. Thus, it is integral for any programmer and software engineer to obtain NLP as a skill set.

## THE FUTURE
##Future Projects
I would like to advacne a stronger Chatbot, specifically to pull information from dynamic pages and pages which require logins and learning Mechanical soup and Selenium. The goal is to develop a way to produce updated list on pending work.

Also, I would like to make more Chatbots with therapeutic intent such as ELIZA. However, I would like to make it in multiple languages, as I think this could be used in poorer countries where pyschology therapy is not avaialbe.

## Continuing Education
As noted earlier, it would be good to learn Mechanical soup and Selenium for web scrapping.
I would like to broaden my knowledge on Pytorch for ML models and graph machine learning
Finally, GPT is here to stay. Integration will most likely in enevitble. I think now is a good time to understand Transformer and Encoders along with GPT technology.
