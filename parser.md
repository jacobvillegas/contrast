# Parsers
#### Fundamentally in working with any corpora, how phrased and parts of speech are grouped togher give insight to the meaning of the text. Likewise parsing provides a means by which setenance strucure conveys meaning. Parser also help debug certain programs as sometimes sentance structure indicates that certain word orders with the same words can convey different meaning.  Here are an example of three utilized sentance parsers PSG, dependency and SRL:
