## SckitLearn API MODELS
#### Text Classification can be done in many ways. SciKit Learn is an API that provides machine learning (ML) tools and well as tools for text classification and predictive data analysis. Here is an example of using Scikit Learns Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression and Neural Net models to complete a text classification of Tweets that could be signs of depression categorized as suicidal or non-suicidal:

## DEEP LEARNING
#### Tensorflow and Keras are one of the most well known API for developing Deep Learning ML modesl. Similary, as done previously, we have done another text categorization, however this time using Keras & Tensorflow to build a sequential model, RNN and utilize embeddings.
