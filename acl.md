# Current Trends in NLP
#### In conclusion, there are many advances made in NLP. Many publications are posted with promising new ideas and novel methodologies to NLP. Here is a small sample from the Association of Computer Learning(ACL), in which a GPT-3 model was modeled to have cognative degredation by masking certain processesin the GPT-3 model. The results, by the author, provide a means to produce Alzheimer dementia like outputs that could be used in controls. A paper critique is provided
